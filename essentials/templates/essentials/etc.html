              Multiple video submissions per participant are allowed, and are welcome.

              Although the syllabus is derived from high school material, participants are <b>strongly encouraged</b> to delve deeper into the topics in their videos and talk about interesting related ideas.

              Submissions will be graded on originality and novelty (of the topic, format and approach), lucidity, depth of the content, audio-visual appeal, coherence, and some more rubrics.

                Selected participants will be invited to attend the eventful on-campus finals, wherein they will interact (in groups) with a committee of IISc professors and representatives from event partners to spend their time at the fest working on making preliminary video content for the (possibly college-level, though with sufficient provision of resources) topics assigned to their group.

                The judgement will be based in the participant's performance in the team-based creation round as well as the intermittent events, to pick a winner as well as a winning team.

              There will be some intermittent events, for example:

                <li>
              Technically charged group discussions before the groups are formed for each topic, as an ideation round where finalists will be closely evaluated for their contributions

                <li>
                   In the form of "flash talks", wherein participants will get about 2 hours to read up on and present for about 10-15 minutes a part of their topic.
                 </li>
                 <li>

                If you plan to send us a video in the future, sign up ASAP with your details, subjects of interest and tentative topic/ideas so that we can make arrangements for the volume of entries, as well as check for significant overlap (there is a heavy emphasis on originality).

              <li>
                If possible, briefly describe your intended approach and try to highlight what will be unique about it. This will help us keep a tab on your submission when it comes. Do note, this is absolutely optional.

If you will have already started on your  video, don't worry - the suggestions will be completely optional and doing something original with an oversubscribed topic is also welcome (and will be noticed).
